This document explains how we compile and execute your solution in Python. __You **MUST** only submit source code.__ 

We support only versions 3.7 and 3.8 for Python solutions.

# Solution without Build files

If you are providing a solution without using the build file, we want you to name your `Main` file as `geektrust.py`. This is the file that will contain your main method.

This file should receive in the command line argument and parse the file passed in. Once the file is parsed and the application processes the commands, it should only print the output.

For e.g your `geektrust.py` file will look like this

```python
def main():
    input_file = sys.argv[1]
    # sys.argv[1] should give the absolute path to the input file
    # parse the file and process the command
    # print the output

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

We build and run the solution by using the following command.

```
python -m geektrust <absolute_path_to_input_file>
```

# Solution with Build files

For Python we support only 1 build system

* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/)

## Pip

Pip is package manager for Python. That means itâ€™s a tool that allows you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library. 

The `pip install` command always installs the latest published version of a package, but sometimes, you may want to install a specific version that you know works with your code. You want to create a specification of the dependencies and versions you used to develop and test your application, so there are no surprises when you use the application in production.

Requirement files allow you to specify exactly which packages and versions should be installed. 

A sample `requirements.txt` file can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geektrust/coding-problem-artefacts/master/Python/requirements.txt)


### Building and running the solution

The `Main` file should be named as `geektrust.py`. This is the file that will contain your main method.

This file should receive in the command line argument and parse the file passed in. Once the file is parsed and the application processes the commands, it should only print the output.

For e.g your `geektrust.py` file will look like this

```python
def main():
    input_file = sys.argv[1]
    # parse the file and process the command
    # print the output

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

We build and run the solution by using the following commands

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m geektrust <absolute_path_to_input_file>
```


### Ading unit tests

We execute the unit tests by using the following command

```
python -m unittest discover
```
